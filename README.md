Capstone Project of Follow The Leader Robot
By Abedallah Abedrabbah and Another(I am keeping my partner's name unknown for his privacy)


The Projects consisted of three follow the leader robots. 
There was the leader and two following or slave robots. 
The robots were designed to be autonomous and be able to run any course given

The concept was that if any autonomous vehicles like  cars, ships and etc. Would ever loose connection with gps or cellular. If there is one that has connection. It would act as a leader to get the other vehicles out until connection is reestablished. 

The robots are made with vex parts, has the  HC-SR04 Ultraosnic sensor, three light sensors and two motors with motor controllers.

The HC-SR04 sensor is used to detect objects infront of the leader to prevent collision.
The light sensors were used to make sure the robots were not going out of bounds of the given course. 
ZigBee modules were used to allow the leader to communicate to the followers.
The microcontroller weas the Atmega328p on the Arduino Uno Development board.
